# Excel Profit Dashboard
This project focuses on building an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze profit trends, regional performance, customer profitability, and product contribution using a cleaned version of the Superstore dataset.
Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a professional, interactive dashboard that can be used by stakeholders to quickly understand profit performance across time, regions, customer segments, and products. Key performance indicators (KPIs) and dynamic filters (slicers) allow for deeper insights into the business performance.
